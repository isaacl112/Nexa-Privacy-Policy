# Nexa Privacy Policy

Welcome to Nexa, an experimental AI developed by VenomIsaacL. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you interact with AniGame. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information.

# 1. Data we collect from Discord

• We collect Guild IDs, Channel IDs, and User IDs only for chatting purposes. It is collected at the assignment of tasks, for example setting up a chat channel, and the guild ID is used for the bot to identify your specific server. User IDs may be used to track individuals blacklisted from using Nexa services.

• We also record command specific information such as where the command was issued, the user that issued the command, and when it was used. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT INTERACT, ACCESS, NOR STORE ANY OTHER MESSAGES OR INFORMATION BESIDES NEXA COMMANDS.

# 2. Does Nexa store any other data apart from this?

• No, we only store Guild IDs and Channel IDs for chatting purposes.

# 3. Data Security

• We take data security seriously and have implemented measures to protect your information. However, please understand that no data transmission or storage method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, it's important to acknowledge that due to our minimal data storage, we anticipate that there would be limited information of relevance beyond the scope of Nexa.

# 4. Disclosure of Data

• We do not share your personal information or data collected by Nexa with third parties unless required by law or as necessary to operate and improve Nexa. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding your data.

# 5. Changes to this Privacy Policy

• We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we collect, use, and protect your data.

# Thank you for adding Nexa to your server and for trusting us with your information. If you have any questions, please reach out to [VenomIsaacL](https://discordapp.com/users/83218406400069632).
